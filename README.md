## üöÄ Generating Releases

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate the creation of a new release and version tag whenever changes are merged into the `main` branch. Here's how it works:

1. **Automated Release Creation**:
   - When a commit is merged into `main`, a new GitHub release is automatically created.
   - This process includes creating a version tag and packaging the generated CV PDF file.

2. **Version Control**:
   - Each release is versioned based on the tags. The versioning follows a simple scheme (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
   - You can view the generated releases by navigating to the [Releases](https://github.com/RArroyo00/Latex-CV-Builder/releases) section of this repository.

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - The workflow triggers automatically on a merge to `main` using a `workflow_dispatch` trigger or a `push` event.
   - Once the workflow completes successfully, the new release is uploaded along with the latest CV PDF.
